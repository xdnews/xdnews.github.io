### AMD's Ambitious Initial Pricing for Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 Revealed

{% include ads/post1.html %}

As AMD's highly anticipated **Radeon RX 9070 XT** and **RX 9070** GPUs continue to build hype, a **Bulgarian retailer** has leaked intriguing details about the initial pricing strategy for these upcoming RDNA 4-based graphics cards. According to the retailer’s report, AMD originally planned to price the **RX 9070 XT** at **$899** and the **RX 9070** at **$749**—prices that might seem questionable given the rumored performance of these cards.

#### Early Leaks and Delay Drama

AMD board partners have already received their initial batch of **Radeon RX 9070 series GPUs**, but due to an extended embargo, they are prohibited from selling or revealing detailed information about the cards. However, a recent leak from the **Bulgarian retailer** provides insight into what AMD's early pricing strategy might have looked like.

In a YouTube video, the retailer showcased the **PowerColor Red Devil Radeon RX 9070 XT**—a version of the GPU that PowerColor previously revealed at **CES**. Despite the official specs and pricing being under wraps, the retailer hinted that AMD had originally planned to position the **RX 9070 XT** to compete with the **RX 7900 XT**, setting its price at **$899**. Meanwhile, the **RX 9070** was expected to be priced at **$749**.

#### The Price-Performance Puzzle

Given that the **RX 9070** is rumored to offer slightly better performance than the **RX 7900 XT**, many are questioning the logic behind such a pricing strategy. If true, the suggested prices appear oddly inflated, especially when compared to competing products from **NVIDIA**.

AMD’s delay in launching the **RX 9070** series, originally scheduled for late January but pushed to March, has likely been influenced by the need for further **software optimizations**. However, it's clear that AMD is working to refine its pricing strategy as the launch date approaches.

#### A Competitive Price Point?

AMD’s **Frank Azor** previously mentioned that the company wants the **70-class RX GPUs** to compete head-to-head with **NVIDIA’s 70-class cards**—such as the **RTX 5070 Ti** and **RTX 5070**. These cards are priced at **$749** and **$549**, respectively, suggesting that AMD might price the **RX 9070 XT** and **RX 9070** more competitively—likely at or below **NVIDIA's price range**.

Interestingly, the **RX 9070 XT** has been spotted in some recent leaks at a more reasonable price of **$529** for a **Gigabyte edition**, which challenges earlier pricing speculation. However, since these early listings can be speculative, the final launch prices are still uncertain.

#### What’s Next for AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 Series?

With AMD’s March launch looming, the company has a narrow window to finalize pricing and ensure it aligns with market expectations. The **Radeon RX 9070 XT** and **RX 9070** are poised to be strong contenders in the GPU market, but whether they can effectively compete with **NVIDIA’s RTX 50 series** depends largely on their final performance and price points.

The rumors and leaks certainly make for an exciting buildup, but **AMD fans** will have to wait until March for confirmation on official pricing and the full specs of these next-gen GPUs.
