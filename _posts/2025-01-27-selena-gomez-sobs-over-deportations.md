### Selena Gomez Breaks Down Over Mass Deportations: 'All My People Are Getting Attacked'

{% include ads/post1.html %}

In an emotional video that was later deleted, singer and actress **Selena Gomez** expressed her devastation over the ongoing mass deportations in the United States. This came after **President Donald Trump**’s administration conducted a large-scale crackdown on illegal immigration, which saw **Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)** arresting 956 people in a nationwide operation.

"I’m sorry," a tearful Gomez wrote in the caption of the video she shared on social media, alongside an emoji of the **Mexican flag**—a nod to her Mexican heritage. Gomez, who is of Mexican and Italian descent, struggled to hold back tears as she spoke to her followers.

**“All my people are getting attacked, the children. I don’t understand,”** she sobbed. **“I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something but I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I’ll try everything, I promise.”**

Following the video, Selena posted a second message on her **Instagram Stories**, where she expressed frustration over the backlash she received for showing empathy. **“Apparently it’s not OK to show empathy for people,”** she said.

Gomez's words resonated deeply with many, coming at a time when immigration policies are at the forefront of political debate. The arrests by ICE are part of President Trump's continued efforts to tighten immigration enforcement in the U.S.

### A Record High in Immigration

The wave of deportations coincides with a significant rise in the foreign-born population in the United States, which reached a record 47.8 million in 2023, according to **Pew Research**. This represents an increase of 1.6 million people from the previous year, marking the largest annual jump in over two decades. 

As the crackdown continues, figures like Gomez are using their platforms to speak out about the impact on immigrant communities and the toll it’s taking on families.
