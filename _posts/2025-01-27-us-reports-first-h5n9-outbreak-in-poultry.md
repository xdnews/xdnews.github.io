### U.S. Detects First H5N9 Outbreak in Poultry Amid Growing Avian Influenza Threat

**Paris, January 27, 2025** – The United States has reported its first-ever outbreak of H5N9 bird flu in poultry, following the discovery of the virus on a duck farm in Merced County, California. The news, confirmed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) on Monday, marks a concerning development as avian influenza continues to spread globally.

In addition to the rare H5N9 strain, the farm was also affected by the more commonly known H5N1 strain of bird flu. Nearly 119,000 birds were culled in early December as part of efforts to contain the outbreak.

This highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), a strain that has affected millions of birds worldwide, has also been reported in various mammal species. In the U.S., dairy cows have been infected, and a fatal case in a person from Louisiana has heightened concerns over the virus’s broader impacts.

In response to the outbreak, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), along with state and wildlife health officials, has launched intensive epidemiological investigations and bolstered surveillance across poultry farms and wildlife habitats.

While avian flu outbreaks are not new, the emergence of new strains like H5N9 raises alarms about the evolving risks to both animal and human health. Authorities are closely monitoring the situation, with experts urging enhanced global cooperation to track and manage future outbreaks.
